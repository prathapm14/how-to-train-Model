# Recommended AI-Generated Images for Azure ML Training Guide

1. **Azure ML Architecture Diagram**: A visual representation showcasing the workspace components such as datasets, compute resources, and models. Use tools like Draw.io or Lucidchart.

2. **Training Workflow Flowchart**: Outline the steps involved in the model training process, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. This can be created using tools like Microsoft Visio or Canva.

3. **Compute Cluster Scaling Visualization**: An illustration showing how compute clusters can be scaled based on demand during model training. Consider using DALL-E or Midjourney for creative visuals.

4. **Experiment Tracking Dashboard Mockup**: Design a mockup that displays metrics such as accuracy, loss, and hyperparameters. Canva or Figma can be suitable for this task.

5. **Model Deployment Pipeline**: A diagram indicating the flow of the machine learning model from development to production. Use Lucidchart or Microsoft PowerPoint for diagram creation.

6. **Cost Optimization Comparison Chart**: A chart comparing different models or methods in terms of resource usage and costs. Infogram or Google Charts may help visualize this comparison.

7. **AutoML Process Flow**: A flowchart detailing the steps involved in the AutoML process, from data ingestion to model selection. Can be done using Draw.io or Visio.

8. **Data Pipeline Architecture**: Diagram showing how data flows from sources to the Azure ML service, including data cleaning and transformation steps. Tools like DALL-E or Midjourney could be used for graphical representation.
